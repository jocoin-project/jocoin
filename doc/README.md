Jocoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Jocoin Core is the original Jocoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Jocoin transactions, which requires approximately 22 gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Jocoin Core, visit [jocoin.io](https://jocoin.io/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Jocoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/jocoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/jocoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run jocoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Jocoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Jocoin Core.
